# ResNet50-HelmDetection

## Overview
This project implements a Helm Detection system using the ResNet50 Models. Helm detection is a crucial task in maritime safety and navigation, aiming to detect and classify the presence of helms in images, but this project is a basic detection.

## Features
- Utilizes the ResNet50 convolutional neural network feature extraction and classification.
- Trained on a small dataset of images containing Helmet and No Helmet
- Offers easy-to-use scripts for model training, evaluation, and inference.
- Includes pre-trained weights for immediate use or fine-tuning on custom datasets.
- Customization.

## Module Contains
- Tensorflow
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- keras
- sklearn
